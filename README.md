# Eneroth Viewport Resizer²

This is the first ever remake of one of my old extensions, Eneroth Viewport Resizer from 2014.

New in this version is the live updates of the viewport size.
The aspect ratio can also be locked to keep the viewport proportions when changing the size.
This aspect ratio can also be picked from the model content.

While not having Mac support yet, the groundwork has been laid to easier add it in the future.
