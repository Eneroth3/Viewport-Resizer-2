# Eneroth Viewport Resizer²

Useful for exporting images consistently between machines or record videos to predefined dimensions.

This is the first ever remake of one of my old extensions, Eneroth Viewport Resizer from 2014.
New in this version is the live updates of the viewport size.
The aspect ratio can also be locked to keep the viewport proportions when changing the size.
This aspect ratio can also be picked from the model content.

Source code available at [GitHub](https://github.com/Eneroth3/Viewport-Resizer-2).

Activated from **Extensions > Eneroth Viewport Resizer²**.
